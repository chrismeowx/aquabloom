# What is Aquabloom?

Efficient water management is a critical factor in sustainable agriculture and horticulture. The AquaBloom system provides water requirement prediction using a decision tree algorithm to determine the precise amount of water required for plants based on their crop type, soil type, region, temperature, and the weather conditions of the plant's region. Based on various environmental factors, Aquabloom enhances irrigation strategies and optimizes plant health and resource efficiency.
